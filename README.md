## Data Controller  
**Flexible, Secure, Auditable Data Changes for SAS® Environments**

**Data Controller** enables business users to safely update IT‑owned source data—without direct table access—while giving data owners full control through approvals, validation, and a complete audit trail.

Built by SAS® practitioners for data‑intensive, regulated environments, Data Controller replaces scripts, spreadsheets, and ad‑hoc database access with a governed, real‑time workflow.

## Why Data Controller?

Most organizations still rely on risky or inefficient methods when data needs to be corrected or overridden:

- Ad‑hoc SAS programs
- Manual database scripts
- Spreadsheet uploads with no governance
- Direct access to sensitive tables

Data Controller provides **self‑service data modification with enterprise‑grade controls**, purpose‑built for SAS® platforms.

## Core Capabilities

### ✅ Governed Self‑Service Editing
Business users can add, modify, or delete data via a web interface or file upload—without needing direct access to source tables. All changes are staged and reviewed before they go live.

### ✅ Review & Approval Workflow
Every change requires one or more approvals. Approvers see a clear, row‑level diff of what will change before accepting or rejecting updates.

### ✅ Full Audit History
Track **who changed what, when, and why**. Original uploads (including Excel files) are retained for audit and compliance purposes.

### ✅ Excel & CSV Uploads
Drag‑and‑drop Excel or CSV files directly into SAS tables—no need to pre‑define formats, lengths, or metadata. Password‑protected Excel files are supported.

### ✅ Advanced Data Models
Native support for:
- SCD Type 2
- Bi‑temporal tables
- Retained and composite keys
- Format catalogs

### ✅ Security by Design
- Role‑based access (Viewer, Editor, Approver, Auditor, Admin)
- Row‑level and column‑level security
- SASLogon‑based authentication
- No direct user access to target tables

### ✅ Zero‑Code Configuration
New tables are added via configuration—not custom code. Schemas, keys, and structures are inferred dynamically at runtime.
